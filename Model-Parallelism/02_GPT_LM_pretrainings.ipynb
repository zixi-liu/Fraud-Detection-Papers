    "# 2.1 Introduction to Distributed Training Strategies\n",
    "In distributed training mode, the goal is to split the training process across multiple machines. The most commonly used distribution strategies are **data** and **model** parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks are usually trained using [Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/a-data-scientists-guide-to-gradient-descent-and-backpropagation-algorithms/) consisting of splitting the dataset into batches processed sequentially. At the forward step, the feature maps are computed while at the backward pass, gradients are computed and averaged to determine the parameter updates. Finally, the next batch of data is processed once the model's parameters are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/data_parallel.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In data parallelism mode, the data is split across multiple machines, each will be processed by a copy of the same neural network hosted by each machine. Parameter updates are averaged from all machines and model updates are reflected on all copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, with more processors (or alternatively higher data parallelism), the time duration of an epoch (i.e. entire dataset) reduces, this has the effect of speeding up training. Also, because the updated gradients have effectively seen a larger number of samples (due to increased global batch size), this has a positive effect on the time to convergence. The time taken per batch is still the same, with the added cost of gradient exchange communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different strategies for implementing the exchange of gradients: \n",
    "- **Centralized** way, where a server machine is responsible for distributing data chunks, accumulating gradients, and updating model parameters. \n",
    "- **Decentralized** way, where each worker sends and collects gradients from others to aggregate and update the model’s parameters locally. In addition, the workers can deliver the computation at different speeds. So, model parameters can be updated in a synchronous way based on the worker's synchronization points. We can also use a relaxed strategy, allowing workers to operate with outdated parameters. This strategy may introduce inconsistency during the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several libraries offer data parallelism implementations such as [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) which is compatible with several Deep Learning Frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Apache MXNet. [NVIDIA APEX](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/) is a Pytorch extension library that offers utilities to streamline distributed training and Mixed Precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Distribution Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Model parallelism is the process of splitting a model’s parameters across multiple machines. This allows training bigger models that do not fit into 1 GPU, with the cost of additional communications due to feature maps exchange. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can distinguish 2 types of model distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pipeline_parallel1.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipeline Parallelism is the process of cutting sequentially a model into pieces and assigning each part to a specific worker. For instance layers 1,2 on device_1 and 3,4 on device_2, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different pipelining strategies such as the Micro-batch pipeline parallelism [GPipe](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.06965.pdf), which is an optimized implementation of model pipelining to minimize the time machines wait for their peers to communicate their outputs. It consists in partitioning data chunks into micro batches enabling different machines to process different micro batches simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](images/pipeline_parallel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a single sequential set of layers per device, the [Interleaved pipeline parallelism](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/) assigns multiple pipeline stages per device, each with less computation. \n",
    "For instance, layers 1,2 and 9,10 on device_1, layers 3,4 and 11,12 on device_2, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensor Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tensor_parallel1.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor Parallelism is the process of dividing matrix operations across workers. [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/) is NVIDIA's open-source library for efficient training of transformer-based networks and multi-node pre-training of transformer-based models such as GPT, BERT, and T5 using mixed precision. In the Megatron's  transformer implementation, the Self-Attention and MLP operations are divided into parallel blocks with a total cost of 4 all-reduce operations per transformer cell (2 on the forward pass and 2 on the backward pass).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tensor_parallel.png\" width=\"250\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Megatron-LM is built on top of PyTorch and it integrates data, pipeline and tensor parallelism for pre-training of GPT and BERT transformers architectures using mixed precision. In this lab, we will be using implemented distribution strategies provided by Megatron-LM library. In particular, we will focus in 1 Node execution on 1 or 2 devices and in the second case, we will use data, tensor and pipeline parallelism. Several examples can be found in the [Megatron-LM repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/examples). \n"
