    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your ability to build and execute large models. Please demonstrate that ability by porting an existing piece of code into DeepSpeed and creating a series of configuration files to enable a range of DeepSpeed functions including: activation checkpointing, mixed precision training as well as ZeRo redundancy optimizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the task containable, we have deliberately selected a simplified codebase, namely minGPT (https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT). This is a minimalistic implementation of Transformers that will not provide maximum performance, but which is representative and should allow you to complete this coding exercise in a relatively short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will look at yet another family of models, namely, Vision Transformers. Before diving into the assignment, please review the [code example](minGPT/minGPT/play_image.ipynb) that we will be using in this assessment. Feel free to execute the above code example but do bear in mind that training to convergence will take a considerable amount of time, so it  might help to finish it early and focus on the code migration discussed below."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, our goal will be to:\n",
    "- Migrate a standalone pytorch implementation of the training pipeline into DeepSpeed and train effectively on our \"two server\" cluster\n",
    "- Enable functionality that will allow for memory saving, namely: Mixed Precision Training, Activation Checkpointing and ZeRo Redundancy optimiser\n",
    "- Increase the size of the model being trained\n",
    "\n",
    "The below notebook will be a guide through the process and provide test code which will help determine whether you are on the right path to the correct solution. By the end of the assessment, when the code is complete, you will be asked to go back to the lab platform and press the `assess` button. This will trigger an automated process which will load your code files as well as the deepspeed configuration files and execute them, assessing correctness of the implementation. Please leave enough time to execute this step as it can take several minutes to compleate. If you are running out of time, please download the files you have modified so that they can be finished later."

    "Let us begin by looking at the starting point of our assessment, namely [runStartingPoint.py](./minGPT/minGPT/runStartingPoint.py). This is the same code that was reviewed earlier, just extracted into a python file to allow us for its batch execution. Let us test it to make sure it works in a standalone mode. Once again, training to convergence will take a substantial amount of time, so once you see training progress feel free to stop the training process and move to the next step."
